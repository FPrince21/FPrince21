### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
To run my file, i set my main function to run the entire application. Simply open the FlightFinder file and run that file.
In addition to change start and destination cities, kindly open the "Input.txt" file and edit the file to your preferred 
start and destination cities. Once that is completed, go back to the FlightFinder class and run the code again, the output file
will now contain the new set of information based on your query in the input file.
